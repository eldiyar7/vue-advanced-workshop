# 3 Day Vue Workshop Outline

This 3 day workshop in Vue will take you through the necessary learning process to be able to confidently build scalable web applications using Vue.js.

Day 1 will be a gentle introduction to the core concepts of Vue - we will cover the template syntax, directives, event handling, form bindings, and most importantly how components work in Vue. We will go through each of these via hands-on exercises.

Day 2 will be dedicated to scalability: we will discuss routing and state management and understand how they are related to Vue's reactivity model. We will implement simple routing and state management solutions from the ground up, then build an actual app with the official `vue-cli`, `vue-router` and `vuex` libraries

Day 3 will be focused on composition and reusability: we will talk about how to write custom directives and plugins, how to use render functions instead of templates, and how to leverage concepts such as higher-order components, abstract components and scoped slots in Vue.
